The android app for the intro project of TimeSquared. The main repository can be found at https://github.com/THECASE99/Introproject_GIT

If you get an error about modules, it's probably because Android studio (or just me because i'm a noob) uses absolute paths for modules instead of relative.
Fix by manually removing and adding jtds and mssql jars and dependencies to the project.
I hope you don't need to do this.
